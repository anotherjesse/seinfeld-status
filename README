Add calendaraboutnothing.com to your firefox status bar
to make sure you don't break your streak of commiting to
open source projects.

Install from:

 * https://s3.overstimulate.com.s3.amazonaws.com/seinfeld.xpi

Usage:

 * Click the red X in your status bar to set your username.

 * After setting your username clicking the X updates your
   current streak.

   Tools -> Addons screen of firefox

TODO:

  * make it so it updates periodically and shows you
    if you have completed todays yet

    - wonder how often calendaraboutnothing updates?
